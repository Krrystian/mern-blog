# Why?
**MERN full-stack website application made for learning purposes.** The idea for this catchy name came to me when I realized that the holidays were coming to an end, then I thought to myself, why? - I made a **30 day challenge to make as much as I can but not more than 1 thing per day**.
I was looking for short full-stack project ideas across whole internet and I have come to the conclusion - it should be short application. I have already created online store using NextJS. It was a very satisfying project but.... ~~I felt it wasn't that difficult~~ I have chosen easier way. **I wanted to learn basics while using my current knowledge** - MERN has been chosen.
